# Copy of sample code from Paul Brebner's Instaclustr blogs from 2017-2024 (1 October version)

These were originally organised differently (by blog or blog series), but were recently changed with a new structure and template etc - the original links from the blogs will be updated hopefully in the future to work again. 
Here are the blogs: https://www.instaclustr.com/blog/author/paul-brebner/
Note that they were originally intended to read in conjunction with the blogs and were just "samples" - not necessarily working standalone applications - but they did all work at one point - check out the blogs to determine the age and therefore the version of the technologies that they worked with originally.
